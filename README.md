## Porting to .NET Core 3.0
For now Visual Studio 2019 only supports the WPF Designer in .NET Framework projects. I have the intention to port this project as soon as Visual Studio starts to support WPF Designer in .NET Core. However, if you wish to do it sooner, there is a work around that explained [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/wpf#wpf-designer).
