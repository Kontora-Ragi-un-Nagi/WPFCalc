# WPFCalc
This project is a Simple Calculator made using WPF and Class Abstraction on the operations. It is more of a tutorial for those starting with WPF, especially those who are migrating from WinForms.  

# What will you need
This project was initially made using
- Visual Studio 2015
- .NET Framework 4.5.2

But it was updated to 
- Visual Studio 2019
- .NET Framework 4.8

Basically only the target framework was updated, so if you really need, you can downgrade it back to your version instead of using the latest version.

#Future features

## Unit Tests
In the near future, I will include some Unit Tests for the operations.

## Porting to .NET Core 3.0
For now, Visual Studio 2019 only supports the WPF Designer in .NET Framework projects. I have the intention to port this project as soon as Visual Studio starts to support WPF Designer in .NET Core. However, if you wish to do it sooner, there is a workaround explained [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/wpf#wpf-designer).
